The files in this folder are makefile snippets, they can be reused across
projects without much change at all.

Features:
  uses wildcards, no need to add files to project when adding code
  works best with pkg-config based dependencies
  is just plain makefile and shellscript - feasible to understand
  dist target - creates tarball if git status . is clean
  generic script and gnu diff based test driving framework

Magic make is a project in progress, but as my need for deduplicating my build
processes grow it might be growin in capability.

How to use:
  drop a symlink into your project and include the parts needed from
  you main Makefile with import .mm/lib inside your own makefile - see the
  examples for a few skeleton projects that even use their directorys
  name as the basis for configuring the project name.

Desirable todos:
  On dist: create a bundle of the included makefiles and drop it in as the
  makefile in the directory - leaving the distribution with a simpler file
  structure.
